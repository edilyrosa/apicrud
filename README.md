This web app was written with vanilla Javascript and use how server the REST API Json Server. So you should run the command  json-server --watch ./data/db.json 
Through techniques of DOM manipulation,  the content and style of HTML tags were handled from JS.
Endpoints to GET, POST, UPDATE & DELETE were created to access the resources of the  REST API. 
The AJAX was made with library axios and the native JS API Fetch. Both logics work, you just call its script tag in index.html 
The possible errors were handled. 
Every step was documented.
